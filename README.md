##Summary

###Purpose of this analysis was to create a dynamic webpage that allows a user to toggle through test subjects in a dataset of research on bellybutton bacteria.  Visualizations include a demographic panel showing information about the test subject, a bar chart showing the top 10 bacteria found in the person's bellybutton, a guage showing how frequently they washed, and a bubble chart showing the bacteria per sample.
